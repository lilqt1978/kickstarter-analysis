# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The Visualizing campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Purpose
The overview of this project is to find out the number projects and determine the percentage of successful,canceled, or failed with their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges I cames across were making sure I was using the correct columns of data to populate the desired result
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The cancelled outcomes were mainly consistent.The successful outcomes were almost half of the total calculated and were stronger in the summer months while the failed outcomes stayed consistent throughout the year as well
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes with the best percentages had lower goals the higher the percentage. The percentage cancelled went up as months passed. The 15000 to 19999 goal had the most data that was double the percentages. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges ecountered were making sure all steps were completed in calculating percentages
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The successful outcomes got better as the year progressed around the summer time the cancelled amount also rose slighly during this time. There arent many cancellations to really affect the desired outcome.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Only 2 goals were semi close to meeting. The rest had varied results depending on the goal. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a bar graph to show a visual of the outcomes or pivot chart
